## Experience

January 2021 - July 2021
INTHERSHIP, FCFM - BUAP
-	I was in charge to design and implement an application note for PYNQ-Z2 development board that is based on the Zynq XC7Z020 (SoC).
-	The designs consist in the use of the ARM A9 with different modules implement in the Programmable Logic of the SoC, these modules were some of the available in the library or created with the High-Level Synthesis tool of Xilinx.
-	The designs were verified with the creation of applications using C and Python (this using the framework Python productivity for Zynq).
-	Derivate of this internship the talk “Implementación de la inversa de una matriz de 3x3 en la tarjeta PYNQ-Z2” was presented in The Eighth International Conference on Mathematics and Its Applications (8CIMA).


MAY 2019
STUDENT, FCE - BUAP
-	Elaboration of two projects for the course "Sistemas Empotrados", that used the soft processor PicoBlaze and MicroBlaze of Xilinx. The two projects were made in collaboration in a team of four members.
-	The project that used Picoblaze was programmed in assembler, using the Spartan 3E development board. The program allows the communication between Picoblaze, the ADC (LTC1407A-1) and a Dual Programmable Gain Amplifiers (LTC6912), SPI was used.
-	The project that used MicroBlaze was programmed with C. The program allows the serial communication, the received data is printed in the LCD of the board.
