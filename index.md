## Experience

January 2021 - July 2021
INTHERSHIP, FCFM - BUAP
-	I was in charge to design and implement an application note for PYNQ-Z2 development board that is based on the Zynq XC7Z020 (SoC).
-	The designs consist in the use of the ARM A9 with different modules implement in the Programmable Logic of the SoC, these modules were some of the available in the library or created with the High-Level Synthesis tool of Xilinx.
-	The designs were verified with the creation of applications using C and Python (this using the framework Python productivity for Zynq).
-	Derivate of this internship the talk “Implementación de la inversa de una matriz de 3x3 en la tarjeta PYNQ-Z2” was presented in The Eighth International Conference on Mathematics and Its Applications (8CIMA).


MAY 2019
STUDENT, FCE - BUAP
-	Elaboration of two projects for the course "Sistemas Empotrados", that used the soft processor PicoBlaze and MicroBlaze of Xilinx. The two projects were made in collaboration in a team of four members.
-	The project that used Picoblaze was programmed in assembler, using the Spartan 3E development board. The program allows the communication between Picoblaze, the ADC (LTC1407A-1) and a Dual Programmable Gain Amplifiers (LTC6912), SPI was used.
-	The project that used MicroBlaze was programmed with C. The program allows the serial communication, the received data is printed in the LCD of the board.


## Education
AUGUST 2016 - DECEMBER 2021
BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN ELECTRONICS, BUAP

OCTOBER 2021 - DECEMBER 2021
DESARROLLO DE TALENTO ESPECIALIZADO, MÓDULO VERIFICACIÓN PRE-SILICIO, INAOE

The next activities were elaborated in a team collaboration.
-	Generation of a Test Bench for combinational design in Verilog, was made a version using C++ and another with Python. In both versions to obtain the information we use regular expressions and dictionaries or maps in C++ and Python respectively to manipulate the information. 
    -	I was in charge of the stimulus generation to test the combinational design.
-	Generation of a Verilog design of a Finite State Machine (Moore or Mealy) and a self-checking test bench.
    -	I was in charge of generate the Verilog design (Moore or Mealy) using Python.
-	Elaboration of the modules of MIPS processor (Single Cycle and Multi Cycle) using Verilog.
    -	I was in charge of the elaboration of the register file, data memory, alu, multiplexer and the Datapath of the MIPS.
-	Elaboration of self-checking Test Benches to test the modules used in MIPS processor.
    -	I was in charge of the elaboration of test benches for the register file, data memory, alu and the multiplexer.
-	Verification of Single cycle MIPS processor using System Verilog.
    -	I was in charge of the random generation of instructions for the test and contributed with the scoreboard to define the required verification to check the functionality of the design.
-	Verification of Multi cycle MIPS processor using UVM.
    - I was in charge of the random generation of instructions for the test and contributed with the scoreboard to define the required verification to check the functionality of the design.
