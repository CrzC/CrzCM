## Experience

January 2021 - July 2021
INTHERSHIP, FCFM - BUAP
-	I was in charge to design and implement an application note for PYNQ-Z2 development board that is based on the Zynq XC7Z020 (SoC).
-	The designs consist in the use of the ARM A9 with different modules implement in the Programmable Logic of the SoC, these modules were some of the available in the library or created with the High-Level Synthesis tool of Xilinx.
-	The designs were verified with the creation of applications using C and Python (this using the framework Python productivity for Zynq).
-	Derivate of this internship the talk “Implementación de la inversa de una matriz de 3x3 en la tarjeta PYNQ-Z2” was presented in The Eighth International Conference on Mathematics and Its Applications (8CIMA).
